                <h2>Abolishing NEET</h2>
                <p>NEET has created significant barriers for students from rural areas and disadvantaged backgrounds. We believe that education should be accessible to all, and a single entrance exam should not determine a student's future. Our plan includes establishing state-level medical entrance exams that consider regional educational patterns, implementing quota systems to ensure representation from all communities, improving the quality of education in government schools to prepare students better, and creating alternative pathways for medical admissions that consider holistic student performance.</p>

                        <li><strong>Year 1:</strong> Form a task force to study and draft a new state-level medical admissions bill. Engage with educators, students, and parents to gather feedback and build consensus.</li>
                        <li><strong>Year 2:</strong> Pass the new admissions bill in the state legislature. Begin the process of setting up a new state medical admissions board and preparing the framework for a state-level exam.</li>
                        <li><strong>Year 3:</strong> Implement the first phase of the new state-level medical entrance exam. Start pilot programs to improve the quality of science education in government schools, focusing on districts with low representation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Year 4:</strong> Fully implement the state-level exam across the state. Expand the education quality improvement programs and introduce a scholarship fund for students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.</li>
                        <li><strong>Year 5:</strong> Evaluate the success of the new system. Work to improve the curriculum and assessment methods based on performance data to ensure all students have an equal and fair opportunity.</li>

                <p>TASMAC shops have contributed to numerous social issues including domestic violence, financial problems, and health issues. We propose a phased approach to reduce alcohol dependency in our society. Our strategy includes gradually reducing the number of TASMAC outlets across the state, implementing comprehensive rehabilitation programs for alcohol-dependent individuals, promoting alternative entertainment and social activities, and creating economic opportunities for those employed in TASMAC to transition to other industries.</p>
